This archive contains the ground truth annotations described in the paper
"Good, Great, Excellent: Global Inference of Semantic Intensities"
by Gerard de Melo and Mohit Bansal. Transactions of the ACL (to appear).

Each cluster begins with a marker "=== " followed by a cluster ID.
The cluster ID is given as a pair of antonyms, with two stars ("**")
used to mark which side of the antonym pair the members originated from.

The next lines then list word forms that constitute the members of this
cluster. Within each cluster, such words are ranked from weak to strong.
In the case of ties, multiple comma-separated words are listed on the
same line.

See Section 4.1 of the paper for more information.
